## Overview

"LONA" is a modern web application designed for buying, selling, and renting properties. It features a responsive and user-friendly interface with advanced search capabilities, an interactive map integration, and secure user account management.

> **Note:** The database is currently **no longer live** and cannot be accessed in the cloud. You will need to set up your own database instance for local or cloud deployment.

## Features

- **Search and Filter Properties**: Users can search properties by criteria such as price, location, size, and property type (e.g., house, apartment, etc.). Advanced filters allow for a personalized search experience.
- **User Authentication**: Users can securely register, log in, and recover their accounts via email. Includes JWT-based authentication for secure access.
- **Interactive Map**: View property locations on an interactive map, filter properties directly on the map, and get directions.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can manage property listings, approve user registrations, and remove inappropriate content.
- **User Profiles**: Users can manage their personal information, save favorite properties, and track their search history.
