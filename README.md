## Project Overview

This project provides a backend that handles property listings, images, and location data for a real estate management platform. The backend connects to a PostgreSQL database hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It allows users to manage property listings, view property details, and store images associated with properties.

### Key Features:

- **Property Listings**: View, add, update, and delete property listings.
- **Location Management**: Manage and retrieve locations for each property.
- **Image Management**: Store images for properties in the database.
- **Cloud Database**: Data is hosted on GCP using PostgreSQL for high scalability and security.
- **Data Handling**: Integrates external property data from Kaggle's **Zameen.com Property Data** dataset for initial property records.

## Features

<<<<<<< HEAD
- **Property Listings**: View, add, edit, and delete property listings with complete details (e.g., price, area, location).
- **Location Management**: Manage property location details (city, province, locality).
- **Image Management**: Handle property images by converting them into binary format for storage in PostgreSQL.
- **Cloud-Based Storage**: Utilize GCP-hosted PostgreSQL for storing and managing property-related data.
- **Data Import from Kaggle**: The initial dataset is sourced from Kaggle’s **Zameen.com Property Data** (available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/huzzefakhan/zameencom-property-data-pakistan)).
=======
- **Property Listings**: View, add, edit, and delete property listings.
- **Location Management**: Manage and retrieve locations associated with properties.

### Image Table

This table holds the image data for properties, with each image associated with a specific property.

| Column Name   | Description                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `image_type`  | Type of the image (e.g., PNG, JPG)                            |
| `date_added`  | Date when the image was added                                 |

### How Images Are Stored in the Database

In this project, property images are stored as binary data in the PostgreSQL database. The images are uploaded by converting them into binary format before storing them in the `image_data` field of the **Image Table**. This ensures efficient management of images and allows easy retrieval when needed.

- **Uploading an Image**: When an image is uploaded, it is converted to binary format and stored in the `image_data` field, linked to a property via `property_id`.
- **Retrieving an Image**: When an image is requested, the binary data is retrieved from the database and converted back into its original format for display, using technologies like **Pillow** for Python or rendering directly through base64 encoding in a web application.
=======
### Images Management

This section handles the management of images associated with each property. Each property can have multiple images linked to it, allowing users to view and manage property visuals.

## Database Connection

This project utilizes a **PostgreSQL** database hosted on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. The database is securely set up for high availability, and all data (property listings, locations, and images) is stored in this cloud-based database. The connection details for the database are configured as environment variables to maintain security and ease of configuration.

To connect to the PostgreSQL database:

1. Install PostgreSQL client libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install psycopg2
   ```

2. Configure the connection string in your backend application using the following structure:

   ```python
   import psycopg2
   from psycopg2 import sql

   conn = psycopg2.connect(
       host="your-gcp-host",
       port="5432",
       database="your-database",
       user="your-username",
       password="your-password"
   )
   ```

3. Ensure that the environment variables for the database credentials are set up securely in your project.

## Data Source

This project incorporates property data sourced from **Kaggle’s Zameen.com Property Data** dataset. The dataset contains information on property listings, including prices, locations, and other details about real estate in Pakistan. It serves as the initial data for populating the system with real-world property listings.

To import the Kaggle dataset:

1. Download the dataset from [Kaggle’s Zameen.com Property Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/huzzefakhan/zameencom-property-data-pakistan).
2. Clean and format the data as required for the database (e.g., converting the price to numeric format, mapping the location fields).
3. Insert the data into the PostgreSQL database using SQL scripts or an automated script written in Python.

---

## Backend Structure

The backend of the project is built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL**.

- **Node.js**: Handles the server and API requests.
- **Express**: Simplifies routing and middleware management.
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores all property-related data securely in the cloud.

### Key Routes

- **GET /properties**: Retrieve a list of properties, with optional filters for price, location, type, etc.
- **POST /properties**: Add a new property listing to the database.
- **PUT /properties/:id**: Update details for an existing property.
- **DELETE /properties/:id**: Delete a property listing.

The backend allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the property listings, manage property locations, and handle property images in a secure and efficient manner.
